    <h2>Exercise One : Counter</h2>
    <p>
      For the first exercise, I did <b>1-Counter</b>. I included in the comments
      of the app.js the algortihm for my code. I wanted to use this exercise as
      a way to give myself a refresher of an animation of some sort with P5. I
      think I did conclude that I need to take some more time to practice and
      get sharper with this language, just because I don't feel super confident
      with it yet. In any case, if you go into the console the code should
      actually work. I played around with the variable a bit to ensure that it
      starts at whatever number I declare the variable to be, and works its way
      up.

    <!-- description for second exercise  -->
    <h2>Exercise Two : World Wrap</h2>
    <p>
      For the second exercise, I did <b>3-World Wrap</b>. I know we did something
      similar during our first actual lab, so I wanted to see if I was able to
      do this myself. I don't know if I was able to execute this the right way,
      and it took a lot of research and trial and error to get to to kind of
      work. I don't really know how well my algorithm is; I do feel like I need
      to learn how to be more descriptive, because I did find myself a bit
      stuck.
