    <h2>Exercise Three : Puck Side</h2>
    <p>
      I definitely did think that this assignment was one of the more cool and
      interesting ones. I felt like using an if statement made things a lot
      easier for this code to come out. I did find it a bit troubling trying to
      figure out how to change the color. I felt a little more comfortable with
      this exercise because I we have touched the MouseX and MouseY function, so
      in the end this wasn't that bad.
